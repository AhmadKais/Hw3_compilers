Hw3_compilers
This homework is for the Compiler Structure course at the University of Haifa with Professor Yossi Ben Asher, Fall semester 2022-2023 (partner Mohannad Abu-Hamad).

The homework assignments in this course are hierarchical, which means that we were given code, and with each homework, we are asked to support more P-code operations and data structures. The HW is written in C++ and it outputs P-machine code.

I have added some inputs, mainly for HW3.
